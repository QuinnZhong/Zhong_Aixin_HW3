# Authoring 3 - Mailer with POST & HW # 3 – Authoring / Web Emailvalidation

Using what you’ve built in the authoring class extend the functionality to include PHP validation
for each of your input elements passed through the $POST array. Once all of the information
has passed the validation, trigger the server to send an email(this cannot be tested locally).
Make sure to include pass and fail messages that are sent back to the UI.

Create a mail API with Vue and AJAX using the POST request. You’ll be sending your mail form
data to a PHP script via Fetch and the POST request. You’ll need to handle both success and
failure via the response object and changes to the UI (handle errors, update with visual cues,
etc).
